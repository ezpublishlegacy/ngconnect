 1. Unpack/unzip

    Unpack the downloaded package into the 'extension' directory of your eZ Publish installation.

 2. Create SQL table in your eZ Publish database

    Extension requires an additional table to be added to your database. Use the following command from your eZ Publish
    root folder, replacing "user", "password", "host" and "database" with correct values and removing double quotes

    mysql -u "user" -p"password" -h"host" "database" < extension/ngconnect/update/database/mysql/1.1/ngconnect-dbupdate-1.0-to-1.1.sql

 3. Activate extension

    Activate the extension by using the admin interface ( Setup -> Extensions ) or by
    appending ngconnect to ActiveExtensions[] in settings/override/site.ini.append.php:

    [ExtensionSettings]
    ActiveExtensions[]=ngconnect

 4. Regenerate autoload array

    Run the following from your eZ Publish root folder

    php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php --extension

    Or go to Setup -> Extensions and click the "Regenerate autoload arrays" button

 5. Include extension/ngconnect/design/standard/templates/ngconnect/ngconnect.tpl
    template in place where you want your login buttons to be displayed.

    You can include it with:
    {include uri='design:ngconnect/ngconnect.tpl'}

 6. Clear caches

    Clear all caches (from admin 'Setup' tab or from command line)
